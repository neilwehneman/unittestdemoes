# unittestdemoes
This is a repository for a demo of unit tests and NSubstitute.

Note that GamePicker.cs has the substance of its two interface implementation methods commented out to highlight a teaching point for unit tests. Those two methods should be un-commented out in order to run the program (rather than for running its tests).
